## Description

This project is a backend application for a social network platform where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. Utilizing MongoDB, an Express.js server, and the Mongoose ODM, it's designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data efficiently.

## Features

The **Social Network API** is a backend application designed to power social networking features for web and mobile applications. This API provides robust support for a wide range of social networking functionalities, including:

- **User Management:** Users can create accounts, update their information, and delete their accounts. Each user's profile includes a unique username, email address, and the ability to have friends and share thoughts.

- **Thoughts Sharing:** Users can post thoughts, allowing them to share text-based content with others. Each thought includes the content of the thought, the creator's username, and timestamps for when the thought was created.

- **Reactions to Thoughts:** Other users can react to thoughts, enabling a dynamic and interactive experience. Reactions are nested within thoughts and include a reaction body, the reacting user's username, and a timestamp.

- **Friend Lists:** Users can maintain a friend list within the network. The API supports adding and removing friends, enabling users to connect and interact with others.

- **Real-time Updates:** The application is designed to support real-time updates, ensuring that users can see the latest thoughts and reactions as they happen.

- **Scalable and Flexible:** Built on MongoDB, a NoSQL database, the API is designed to efficiently handle large volumes of unstructured data. This makes it scalable and adaptable to the needs of growing social networks.

- **Timestamp Formatting:** Utilizes customized timestamp formatting to present dates and times in a user-friendly manner, adapted to the local timezone of the user.

### Schema Virtuals

- **Friend Count:** A virtual attribute on the User model that dynamically calculates the number of friends a user has.

- **Reaction Count:** A virtual attribute on the Thought model that provides the count of reactions a thought has received.

### Bonus Features

- **Cascading Deletes:** When a user is deleted, all associated thoughts and reactions are automatically removed from the database, ensuring data integrity and cleanliness.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have [Node.js][node-js] and [MongoDB][mongo-db] installed on your machine.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/naturuplift/SocialNetworkAPI.git
```

3. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd social-network-api
npm install
```

5. Seed the database:

```bash
npm run seed
```

6. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can use an API client like [Insomnia][insomnia] to test the API routes.

- **/api/users routes** for users display data in a formatted JSON.
